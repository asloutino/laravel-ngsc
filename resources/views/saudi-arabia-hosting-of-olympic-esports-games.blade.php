This is a recognition of the skill, dedication, and athleticism of esports players, who will have the opportunity to write their names in history as the first winners of the Olympic Esports Games next year in Saudi Arabia. The world will witness esports' true impact as players across the globe come together to compete at the highest level, showcasing their talents on the grandest stage.”</p>

Beyond giving esports athletes a chance to represent something much bigger than themselves by competing for their countries in 2025, this is also an opportunity for Olympic values to reach and inspire an entirely new audience.”</p>
